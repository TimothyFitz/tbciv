Fog of war:
    Cities could slowly "push" the fog of war back, so you wouldn't have to "fill in the gaps" around your city.
    OR, filling in the gaps could be a simple way to pass cycles at times? (When wouldn't you want to explore of exploring is fun? City with blind spots looks lame though)

Terrain Generator:
    Mazing would be a lot of fun
    Walls with rare entrances seperating climates / zones

    Terrain that's fun to explore vs Terrain that's fun to settle down in (no settling?)

    Terrain "Rares"
        Brown, Blue, Red, Gold borders (plus flourished tiles themselves)
        Indicates scarcity of tile, instantly makes them feel awesome
